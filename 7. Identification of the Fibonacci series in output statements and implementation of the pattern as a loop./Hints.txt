Abstract parts of the solution:
The identifiable pattern is the fibonaci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting after a predefined 0 and 1. Then iterate n times over this pattern.

Language Constructs needed in a solution or have to be understood:
Assignment operator: =
Arithmetic Operators + and ++
Comparison operator <
Stream Output operator <<
Integer Literals and Variables
For-Loop

2.
Here is a detailed Algorithm for the solution:
Initialize 'a' to 0 and 'b' to 1 to represent the starting values of the sequence.
Use a 'for' loop to iterate 'n' times, starting from 0 and counting up to 'n - 1'.
Inside the loop, print the value of 'a' to display the current value in the sequence.
Calculate the next value in the sequence by adding 'a' and 'b', and store it in a temporary variable called 'next'.
Update the value of 'a' by setting it equal to the current value of 'b'.
Update the value of 'b' by setting it equal to the 'next' value, which prepares it for the next iteration.
Repeat steps 4 to 7 in the loop until 'n' values in the sequence have been printed.
The program will display the desired sequence based on the identified pattern, as specified by the user.

3.
Here is the solution, but you have to bring the statements into the correct order:
a = b;
int a = 0, b = 1;
int next = a + b;
cout << a << endl;
b = next;
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)

4.
Solution:
int a = 0, b = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cout << a << endl;
        int next = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = next;
    }
