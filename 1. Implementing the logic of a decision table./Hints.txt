1. 
Abstract parts of the solution:
Implement the decision logic based on the given decision table to determine the corresponding action.
For each rule you can implement a separate condition.
Display the result (action) based on the condition to the user.

Language Constructs needed in a solution or have to be understood:
Logic operators: !, &&, || and the stream output operator <<
Boolean datatype, the use of variables, Expressions if/else-statements 

2.
Here is a detailed Algorithm for the solution:
If inStock, completedDetails, and isCreditworthy are all true, output "Action: Delivery with invoice."
If inStock and completedDetails are true, but isCreditworthy is false, output "Action: Delivery by cash on delivery."
If inStock is true, completedDetails is false, and isCreditworthy is true, output "Action: Complete the details."
If inStock is true, but both completedDetails and isCreditworthy are false, output "Action: Complete the details."
If none of the above conditions are met, output "Action: Inform: Not deliverable."
Display the result (the determined action) to the user based on the decision logic.
This will provide clear guidance on what action should be taken in the given scenario.


3.
Here is the solution, but you have to bring the statements into the correct order and add Braces {}:
cout << "Action: Complete the details" << endl;
cout << "Action: Delivery by cash on delivery" << endl;
cout << "Action: Inform: Not deliverable" << endl;
else if (inStock && !completedDetails && isCreditworthy) 
else if (inStock && !completedDetails && !isCreditworthy)
else 
else if (inStock && completedDetails && !isCreditworthy) 
cout << "Action: Delivery with invoice" << endl;
if (inStock && completedDetails && isCreditworthy) 
cout << "Action: Complete the details" << endl; 

4. 
if (inStock && completedDetails && isCreditworthy) {
        cout << "Action: Delivery with invoice" << endl;
    } else if (inStock && completedDetails && !isCreditworthy) {
        cout << "Action: Delivery by cash on delivery" << endl;
    } else if (inStock && !completedDetails && isCreditworthy) {
        cout << "Action: Complete the details" << endl;
    } else if (inStock && !completedDetails && !isCreditworthy) {
        cout << "Action: Complete the details" << endl; 
    } else {
        cout << "Action: Inform: Not deliverable" << endl; 
    }
