Abstract parts of the solution:
Check the value of salary.
Based on the different ranges use conditions for the different ranges to calculate and return the tax amount.
Keep in mind that for one salary, multiple tax rates might need to be applied at the same time.

Language Constructs needed in a solution or have to be understood:
Binary Arithmetic Operators : +,-,*,/
Comparison Operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
Floating Point Literals
if/else-statements
return-statements of functions

Here is a detailed Algorithm for the solution:
First, we check if the salary is less than or equal to 1000.00 €. If it is, there is no tax to be paid, so we return 0.00 €.
If the salary is greater than 1000.00 €, we proceed to the next step and check if it is less than or equal to 4500.00 €.
If the salary falls between 1000.01 € and 4500.00 €, we calculate the tax amount using an 18% tax rate on the portion of the salary that exceeds 1000.00 €. This is done by subtracting 1000.00 € from the salary and then multiplying the result by 0.18 (18%).
If the salary is greater than 4500.00 €, we calculate the tax amount using a 32% tax rate on the portion of the salary that exceeds 4500.00 €. In this case, we add the taxes calculated in the previous steps.
Finally, we return the total calculated tax amount.

Here is the solution, but you have to bring the statements into the correct order and add Braces{}:
return 0.00;
else if (salary <= 4500.00)
return 3500.00 * 0.18 + (salary - 4500.00) * 0.32;
return (salary - 1000.00) * 0.18;
else 
double calculateTax(double salary)
if (salary <= 1000.00)

Solution:
double calculateTax(double salary) {
    if (salary <= 1000.00) {
        return 0.00;
    } else if (salary <= 4500.00) {
        return (salary - 1000.00) * 0.18;
    } else {
        return 3500.00 * 0.18 + (salary - 4500.00) * 0.32;
    }
}
