Task Text:
Given is the following C++ program that reads in the numerator and denominator of a fraction as two int variables.
Implement the program parts between the input and output so that the entered fraction is reduced. 
A reduced fraction means that the fraction 2/4 is reduced to 1/2

Examplary Test Cases: 
Input: 12 4
Output: Reduced: 3/1

Input: 5 25
Output: Reduced: 1/5
	
Input: 348 100
Output: Reduced: 87/25

Prefilled Answer Field: 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int numerator, denominator;
    cin >> numerator;
    cin >> denominator;


    //Your code goes here, and perhaps above the main-function


    cout << "Reduced: " << numerator << "/" << denominator << endl;

    return 0;
}
