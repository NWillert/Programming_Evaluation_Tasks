1. 
Abstract parts of the solution:
Understand that you need to either use bitwise or arithmetic operations to swap values.

Language Constructs needed in a solution or have to be understood:
Assignment operator =
Integer datatype
Some of the arithmatic operators, ^,*,/,-,+

2.
Here is a detailed Algorithm for the solution:
Set num1 to the sum of num1 and num2. Set num2 to the difference of num1 and num2. Set num1 to the difference of num1 and num2.
Same could be done with the product and the quotient.
Alternatively, perform the following bitwise XOR operations between num1 and num2 three times.

3.
Here is the solution, but you have to bring the statements into the correct order:
x = x - y;
y = x - y;
x = x + y;

OR

num1 = num1 ^ num2;
num1 = num1 ^ num2;
num2 = num1 ^ num2;

4.
Solution:
x = x + y;
y = x - y;
x = x - y;

OR
x = x * y;
y = x / y;
x = x / y;

OR
num1 = num1 ^ num2;
num2 = num1 ^ num2;
num1 = num1 ^ num2;
