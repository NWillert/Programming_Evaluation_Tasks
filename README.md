# Programming_Evaluation_Tasks

Programming Concepts as Knowledge Components for students self-assessment
- List of all components necessary for the programming tasks. 
- Students can report which components they are familiar with and which are unknown.

Hints for Programming Concepts
- Containing an hint for each programming concept, including a short description and often an isolated code example.
